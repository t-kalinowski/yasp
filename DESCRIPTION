Title: String Functions for Compact and Expressive Code
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tomasz Kalinowski
Maintainer: Tomasz Kalinowski <tkalinow@asu.edu>
Description: A collection of string functions designed for writing more
    compact and expressive code. 'yasp' (Yet Another String Package) is simple,
    fast, dependency-free, and written in pure R. The package provides: a
    coherent set of abbreviations for paste() from package 'base' with a
    variety of defaults, such as p() for "paste" and pcc() for "paste and
    collapse with commas"; wrap(), bracket(), and others for wrapping a
    string in flanking characters; unwrap() for removing pairs of characters
    (at any position in a string); and sentence() for cleaning whitespace
    around punctuation and capitalization appropriate for prose sentences.
